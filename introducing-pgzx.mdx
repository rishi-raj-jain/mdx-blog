As part of the [Xata launch week](), we are introducing [pgzx](https://github.com/xataio/pgzx), a library for developing PostgreSQL extensions written in Zig. It provides a set of utilities (e.g. error handling, memory allocators, wrappers) as well as a build and development environment that simplify integrating with the Postgres code base.

## What is Zig?

[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is described on its website as a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.

## Why Zig for Postgres development

## Why not Rust?
