In a typical development workflow, schema changes to an application’s database can take a long time, and roll backs are often error prone. That’s why we’ve created [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) - an open source Postgres tool for zero-downtime and reversible schema migrations.

With our public beta today, pgroll is now the underlying technology used behind our schema change APIs for the Xata web application ([app.xata.io](http://app.xata.io)), CLI and SDK. Using pgroll behind the scenes allows us to dogfood our product, as well as de-risk migrations by providing a standardized API. It also means that users will have more find grained control over their databases.

## New features

Users have consistently voiced a number of pain points, from adding constraints, to column editing, to having more flexible schemas during the initial data modelling phases. Using the capability pgroll provides behind our direct access to postgres feature allows us to address a lot of issues.

Users will notice some new features such as:

- **The ability to add and remove constraints after creating columns**
  1.  For example, modifying a column to be not null or unique after a column has been created and contains data is now possible.
- **The ability to create columns that are not nullable with no defaults**
  1.  \*\*\*\*These columns will be populated with a “zero” column value depending on the column’s type.
- **The ability to run raw arbitrary SQL migrations on the underlying database to create column types outside of the known Xata types, as well as constraints, foreign keys, and other Postgres native supported objects.**

## Enabling direct Postgres access

We’ve also shipped a shiny new redesign to accompany the roll out of the direct access to Postgres feature on our web app (app.xata.io). In order to access them users must first do two things.

    1. Enable direct access for your workspace

    2. Enable direct access when creating their database

## New migration experience

Once done, there will be new options to edit columns on the table view and schema view.

There will also be a new tab called Migration Editor on the Schema view page. Users can run arbitrary migrations with type safe completions. A set of examples can be found in the [pgroll repository](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples)

The Schema History tab has also had makeover. The Schema History tab contains a list of all the migration operations that have been run a the user’s database schema up until now. Information such as the migrations status, migration type (whether it was run using pgroll or directly with SQL), and contents can also be viewed.

Note that our internal columns have been renamed. We now use `xata_id` rather than `id` as the table's primary key, and `xata_updatedat`, `xata_createdat`, and `xata_version` for internal metadata.

## SDK and CLI changes

For users that do not have direct access to Postgres enabled for their workspace, there will be no changes to the existing APIs when using our CLI and SDK.

For users that do choose to enable “direct access to Postgres” in their workspace, they will need to update to the latest CLI and SDK version and create a new and empty database (also with direct access to Postgres enabled). We do not currently support enabling direct Postgres access on existing databases. Users will then have to run `xata db pull` .

The only things that change for these new Postgres enabled databases in terms of our API are primary key names and internal meta data field names. The`id`fields has been renamed to `xata_id`, and `xata.createdAt`, `xata.updatedAt`, and `xata.version` fields have been renamed to `xata_createdat`, `xata_updatedat`, and `xata_version`.

## Technical challenges

Integrating pgroll within our web application and developer packages has posed some interesting technical challenges. Some of the main challenges we encountered were:

- **Backwards compatibility with existing migration workflows**
  - We wanted to continue to support databases that did not have direct access to Postgres enabled so as not to break existing users’ queries. In order to maintain backwards compatibility for existing databases, we had to figure out some way to communicate to the backend whether we wanted to use the new APIs with the internal columns renamed, or the old ones. We settled on a combination of feature flags and request headers.
- **Support for arbitrary Postgres-native column types**
  - Prior to the integration, there was a relatively small list of column types that we knew a column could be. Arbitrary raw SQL migrations over pgroll greatly expanded that list as users could create their own Postgres native column types. We had to do a lot of mapping between these new native Postgres types and the known Xata column types, as our web application has custom React components for displaying, editing, and adding data according to a column’s Xata type. Some of these new Postgres native types also could not be mapped into our existing Xata types as they do not work with our Data API, so figuring that out and handling those cases gracefully was a challenge.
- **Detecting when a migration is complete**
  - pgroll does not allow for referencing items created in previous operations in subsequent operations within the same migration. This means that running an `alter_column` operation after an `add_column` operation, or running a `rename_constraint` operation (requires a table name) after a `rename_table` operation within the same migration request is not currently possible. This is due to the fact that the first operation in the list is guaranteed to compete before the second operation, but the first operation is not guaranteed to complete before the second operation starts. Since the backend provided only an asynchronous `apply` endpoint which would respond with a `jobId`, we had to use the returned `jobId` as input to a second new endpoint called `status` which would return the state of that migration, and poll that until the migration in question succeeded or failed before moving forward with the dependent migration.

## Plans for GA

- Migrate all databases to pgroll
- More information about migrations, for example we only show successful and pending migrations in the migrations tab and we would like to show more information.
- The ability to change a columns underlying type after creating it.
- multiple schema version
- migration workflows (GH is currently disabled)
